# MCP Server Practice

This project is dedicated to learning and practicing with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. MCP is a standardized protocol that enables AI assistants to connect securely to data sources and tools.

## Overview

This practice project will help you understand and implement various aspects of MCP servers, including:

- Understanding the MCP protocol and architecture
- Creating custom MCP servers
- Implementing different types of tools and resources
- Working with prompts and completions
- Error handling and debugging
- Testing and deployment strategies

## Getting Started

To begin practicing with MCP servers, you'll need:

1. Familiarity with the MCP specification
2. A development environment set up
3. Basic understanding of JSON-RPC protocols
4. Knowledge of the programming language you'll be using

## Project Structure

This repository will contain various MCP server implementations and examples as you progress through your learning journey.

## Resources

- [Official MCP Documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)
- [MCP GitHub Repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol)
- [MCP Specification](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/)

## Practice Areas

- **Basic Server Setup**: Creating your first MCP server
- **Tool Implementation**: Adding tools that the client can invoke
- **Resource Handling**: Serving structured data
- **Prompt Engineering**: Implementing prompt templates
- **Error Handling**: Proper error responses and debugging
- **Authentication**: Secure server implementations
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests for MCP servers

Happy coding!
